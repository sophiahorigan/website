My name is Sophia Horigan and I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Chicago studying infectious disease dynamics in the Department of Ecology and Evolution.

To learn more about my work, service, and interests, check out my:

### [Past and current research projects](/research)
From putative zoonoses in bats to insect fungal pathogens, my research has taken me through all the scales of infectious disease dynamics. 
### [Work supporting educational programming for Malagasy students](/outreachprogramming)
With a passion for equitable education opportunities, I've sought out opportunities to support and lead educational programming.
### [Service to the University of Chicago community](/communityservice)
The COVID-19 pandemic began six months after I started my PhD, and my way to get through was to give back - read about how I became involved in pandemic and post-pandemic programming to support the mental, physical, and emotional health of the University of Chicago student community.
### [Teaching experience](/teaching)
I love to teach, whether its a graduate course or citizen science project. 

## About Me

A love for the outdoors as a result of growing up in gorgeous Southern California led me to pursue Biology as an undergraduate at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. I remember thinking, people get paid to be outside and engage with nature?! Through undergrad I developed a strong foundation in ecology, but it wasn't until I took a disease ecology course in my senior year that I found my passion. Disease ecology combined everything I found interesting, bridging scales from within-host dynamics to global pandemics. 

I decided to take on a PhD studying infectious disease dynamics at the University of Chicago in the Department of Ecology and Evolution. Over the past five years I've honed my skills in mathematical and statistical modeling of infectious diseases in systems ranging from insects to bats, taking me from Michigan to Madagascar.

During my time in Madagascar I witnessed the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, and the consequences of destroying biodiversity. I hope to leverage my skillset to perform research and enact programming focused on One Health, working to preserve our precious landscapes and uplift communities around the world.
